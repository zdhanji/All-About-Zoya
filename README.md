# All-About-Zoya
I added a README.md somewhere else, I might have not done it right.
Project 0 became my first attempt at coding, ever. I have never taken a computer science course, but I always love a challenge. I would love some feedback on how I can do better and what I can work on.
I used Project 0 to create my own personal webpage. It contains information about me, my interests (hobbies), social media platforms and contact information.
